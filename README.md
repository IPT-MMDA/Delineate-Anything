> Upcoming Release!
> The code, pre-trained models, and the FBIS-22M dataset are currently being prepared for release and will be available here shortly. Please upvote this repository to ensure you don't miss any updates! Stay tuned for more information.

This repository contains PyTorch implementation for paper "Delineate Anything: Resolution-Agnostic Field Boundary Delineation on Satellite Imagery". 

Trained on the 22M+ instances in the FBIS-22M dataset, **Delineate Anything** sets a new SOTA by accurately delineating individual agricultural field boundaries across diverse satellite resolutions and geographic regions.
