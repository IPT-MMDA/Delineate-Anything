> Upcoming Release!
> The code and pre-trained models have been released. The FBIS-22M dataset is currently being prepared for release and will be available here shortly. Please upvote this repository to ensure you don't miss any updates! Stay tuned for more information.

This repository contains PyTorch implementation for paper "Delineate Anything: Resolution-Agnostic Field Boundary Delineation on Satellite Imagery". 

Trained on the 22M+ instances in the FBIS-22M dataset, **Delineate Anything** sets a new SOTA by accurately delineating individual agricultural field boundaries across diverse satellite resolutions and geographic regions.

Download one of the models and set the path in `inference.py` before running.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To set up the environment on a Linux system:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda install -c conda-forge gdal

pip install torch==2.6.0
pip install ultralytics==8.3.96
```

## üöÄ Inference

1. Place your RGB images into the `images/` folder.  
   _(Three Sentinel-2 sample images are provided for testing.)_

2. Download one of the pre-trained models from the ‚ÄúPre-trained Models‚Äù table above.

3. Run the inference script:

   ```bash
   python inference.py
   ```
4. The vectorized field boundaries will be saved as a GeoPackage here:
```result/result.gpkg```


‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip: You can adjust MINIMAL_CONFIDENCE in inference.py (currently set to 0.175) to control the sensitivity of field detection. Lower values may detect more boundaries but will increase the inference time.
